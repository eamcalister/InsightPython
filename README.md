# InsightPython
Python code to parse Insightmaker files.

This repository contains Python files to parse Insightmaker files and display associated simulation results in Python.
This is essentially proof of concept and should not be considered a truly finished product!

These were written to be run in Anaconda Spyder. To use
1. Download files to a local folder.
2. Open InspyDF (DF is for data frame).
3. Run to plot the solution to the logistic equation.
This Insightmaker file is from https://insightmaker.com/insight/1GfjNalMaqj3KyKRDCYM3p.

The second version is using the file InsightUI, which relies on a separate function the Insightmaker file. It will open a small user interface and allow you to navigate to the Insightmaker file and execute it.
